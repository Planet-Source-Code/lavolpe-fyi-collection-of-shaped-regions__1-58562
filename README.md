### Description

27 shaped regions from 3 functions can be used for custom buttons, windows or whatever. The logic used is pretty easy to follow so you can create even more shapes & add them to your collection. Also included is a simple but effective routine to add 3D-ish border to those shapes & could be used to apply borders to most custom shapes. A what-if project that took off but really can't use the code for anything right now -- hope you can find a good home for it :) <>Updated to include right triangles & showing a digitial timer as a practical example of using regions for drawing.
